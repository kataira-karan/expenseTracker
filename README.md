Cultivating Better Money Management Habits as an Immigrant in Canada

There was a time when I never imagined myself meticulously tracking my spending, but life took me on a journey to Canada where I now share expenses with friends on a daily basis.
From groceries to household essentials, utilities, and dining out, our financial lives are deeply intertwined. To maintain transparency and fairness, we rely on Splitwise to manage our shared expenses.

I'm also a dedicated user of Notion for documenting various aspects of my life. 
However, I found myself in a time-consuming and repetitive cycle. Every time a friend added an expense in Splitwise, I had to manually log my share in Notion, and it had to be done daily.
As you can imagine, this became quite a tedious task, and I often forgot to update Notion with new expenses.

The Solution: Automating Expense Tracking

To simplify this process and enhance my financial tracking, 
I decided to leverage the power of the Splitwise API and the Notion API. 
I created an application that runs automatically at 12:00 AM each day. 
It fetches all the expense notifications generated in the past 24 hours from Splitwise and seamlessly updates my Notion database. 
The app doesn't just add the expenses; it also calculates the total expenditure, giving me a real-time snapshot of my spending habits.

Now, managing shared expenses is not a chore but a breeze, and my Notion page is always up to date. It's a testament to how technology can make our lives more efficient and free up time for more enjoyable pursuits."
